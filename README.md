# multireader_metrics
For computing the multi-reader generalizations of the Jaccard and Sorensen Indices for object detection and instance segmentation


*overlays_to_npy.py*
converts ImageJ overlays (manual segmentations) to .npy label matrix

*calculate_reader_agreement.py* 
computes pairwise comparisons between readers and the multi-reader generalizations described in 'Generalizations of the Jaccard Index and SÃ¸rensen Index for assessing agreement across multiple readers in object detection and instance segmentation in biomedical imaging' (Durkee et. al. 2023)

*agreement_plots_and_stats...*
these scripts compute the statistical comparisons and generate plots for multi-reader comparisons

*CP_vs_consensus.py*
computes the performance of Cellpose2.0 relative to the manual annotations provided by multiple human readers. Consensus is defined by N readers agreeing on a single object
